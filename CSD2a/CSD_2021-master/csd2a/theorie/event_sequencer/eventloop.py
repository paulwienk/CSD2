#
# Example of an event-based sequencer
#
# There is no 'end of sequence', which results in an odd timing at the end
#  of each loop
#
# The loop runs in its own thread and user input is processed in the main
# thread, so the speed can be changed while the loop is playing.
# Implementation is quick-and-dirty.
